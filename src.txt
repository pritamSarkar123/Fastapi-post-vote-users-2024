original code and deployment in heroku and ubuntu 
https://github.com/Sanjeev-Thiyagarajan/fastapi-course


check the modified github workflow file
https://github.com/Sanjeev-Thiyagarajan/fastapi-course/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml

it does not cover initial deployment in ubuntu and in heruku, you have to do it manually,
but after that it is completely managed by the workflow
as I do not have heroku and digital ocean access, I have not added those deployment jobs in workflow
